## TASK DESCRIOTON:

In this Python project, real-time weather data is retrieved from a public API and displayed in an easy-to-understand bar chart. Educating novices on how to include an API into a Python script, retrieve particular data (such as temperature), and display it using a simple chart is the aim. This project retrieves current weather data for several cities using the OpenWeatherMap API, then uses the matplotlib package to display the temperatures. Students or anyone new to programming and data visualisation will find it ideal because of its straightforward and understandable design.

The initial phase of the program is for the user to choose which cities you wish to view the weather. The OpenWeatherMap API then receives a request for each city and provides an object of JSON with comprehensive weather information. Each response's current temperature (in Celsius) is extracted by the script, which then saves the readings in a list. Following the collection of data for every city, a bar chart is produced using matplotlib, in which the height of each bar represents the current temperature and each bar represents a city. To make the chart easier to read, it has a title, labelled axes, and city names that are rotated.

Simple error handling is built into the program to increase its dependability. The application prints an error message and moves on to the next city rather than stopping entirely if the API request is unsuccessful, possibly because the city name was entered incorrectly, the API key was missing, or there was a network issue. This makes it more likely that the script will function properly even in the event of sporadic problems. The utilisation of public APIs and real-time data also aids students in comprehending how contemporary online applications operate with real-time data.

This project is also an excellent illustration of how to handle JSON responses in Python and make API calls using the requests library.  These abilities are necessary for many practical programming tasks, particularly in web development and data science.  Additionally, learning how to visually represent data—a crucial component of data analysis and presentation—is facilitated by using matplotlib for plotting.  Users can more readily understand trends and differences when numbers are transformed into visual graphics.

It is easy to extend this script.  Users can, for instance, add more cities to the list, add weather information such as wind speed or humidity, or even retrieve and plot weather forecasts rather than just the current conditions.  Additionally, they could incorporate the script into a bigger program, like a weather dashboard, or save the chart as an image file.  These concepts all present chances for education and personalisation.

In conclusion, this project provides a useful and hands-on introduction to Python data visualisation and API integration. It teaches how to handle common errors, manage API responses, work with real-time data, and present data in an understandable manner. It is perfect for novices who wish to learn important programming concepts while creating something practical.
